# Analyzing-Promotional-Effectiveness-with-A-B-Testing

To increase customer acquisition for "Delivery Club" membership of a Retail store, we test the impact of different promotional mailers campaign on signup rates. Two mailer designs—basic (Mailer 1) and premium (Mailer 2)—were evaluated against a control group that received no mailer. The goal is to determine the effectiveness of the mailers and assess whether the premium version justifies its higher cost. Identifying this difference is crucial for optimizing marketing expenditures and ensuring cost-effective customer acquisition strategies.

For this business challenge, we conduct an A/B Test, a statistical approach for comparing two variations (Mailer 1 and Mailer 2) by analyzing the differences in their signup rates. This method ensures a data-driven conclusion on whether the premium mailer significantly outperforms the basic version
